		<p>Hi! My name is Dylan. I am a Sophomore at Oakland Unity High. 
		Im 5'2, and I love to play videogames.  In the future, I want to be an engineer. 
		I want to attend either UC Berkeley, or UC Santa Cruz, both are great schools. 
		Im not sure what type of engineer I would like to be, but something that has to do with videogames, since I have played videogames ever since I was 3. Fun Fact, the first game that I have ever played was Grand Theft Auto Vice City on the original Xbox. I have also watched anime since I was a kid, my dad would allways watch Dragon Ball Gt and I would watch it with him. As a kid, I have also watched a lot of anime. My favorite anime at the moment is Darling In The Franxx. My favorite artist is probably The Weeknd, im not sure why, probably his voice and lyrics. They both match so well, and most of the songs he makes I can relate too. My favorite game at the moment is Fortnite, I feel like I am an expert at that game. Probably my favorite game of all time will be either call of duty black ops 2 or Halo 3. </p>
